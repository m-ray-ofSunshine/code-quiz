# Minnesota Quiz 
> Homework Assignment #4

This is a 10 question quiz that is dynamically populated from the JavaScript file. If you add a question to the question list there shouldn't be any code to add other than the question as an object.


## Features

There are 10 questions currently. When you click the start button the quiz starts and the timer starts counting down. 

The question and answers are displayed. If you click the wrong answer then "Try again" is diplayed. When you click on the right answer you are brought to the next question in the list. 

If the timer runs out then the finish text and inputs are displayed. If you finish all questions then your score is the time left on the timer.

You can enter your name to store your score. I was unable to get it to work.
